name: filet
description: Run the filet code-quality checker on a project and fix what it finds — style, architecture, cognitive complexity, Dockerfiles (droast), and the multi-language test runner. Use when the user asks to check code quality, roast the code, lint the project, review a Dockerfile, enforce the team guidelines, run the test suites, or set up filet in a repo. Also runs on "/filet".

# filet

`filet` is a single Go binary: a style checker, a code roaster, a Dockerfile roaster and a test
runner. It is deterministic and offline — no model call is involved in producing a finding. Your job
is to run it, judge the findings, and fix the ones worth fixing.

## Commands

```sh
filet check  [path]   # findings only
filet roast  [path]   # findings plus commentary and an A-F grade
filet docker [path]   # every Dockerfile found; droast is the same thing
filet test   [path]   # detect and run the project's test suites
filet init   [path]   # write a commented filet.yml (-preset relaxed|epitech)
filet rules           # every rule id and what it means
```

Flags on `check`/`roast`/`docker`: `-format auto|text|line|json`, `-fail info|warn|error|never`,
`-quiet`. Positional path first, then flags: `filet check internal -format json`.

`-format auto` (the default) emits the grouped human report on a terminal and the one-per-line
format everywhere else — which means **your** tool calls already get the parseable form.

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings at or above `failOn`, `2` bad usage or unreadable input.

If the binary is missing, build it from `~/Projects/Facile/Code/filet` with `go build -o bin/filet .`, or
`mise run install`. Never reimplement a check by hand when the binary can answer.

## Workflow

1. **Locate the config.** `filet` walks up for `filet.yml` and stops at the repository root, so a
   config outside the repo is deliberately ignored. If none exists and the user wants one,
   `filet init` and explain the presets rather than inventing thresholds.
2. **Pick the format for the job.** `-format json` when you need to group and count. `-format line`
   for `path:line:column: severity: message [rule]`, which pipes straight into `grep`, `cut` and
   `sort`. `-format text` or `roast` when the user is going to read it themselves — and pass it
   explicitly, since a tool call is not a terminal and would otherwise get `line`.
3. **Triage before editing.** Group by rule id, then by file. Report the shape of the problem
   ("14 findings, 9 of them one dispatcher") before touching anything.
4. **Fix causes, not symptoms.**
5. **Re-run** and report the delta honestly, including what you left.

## The rule that matters most

**Never silence a finding to make the output green.** Raising a limit in `filet.yml`, adding a rule
to `disabled:`, or dropping to a looser preset are all last resorts, allowed only when the user asks
or when the finding is genuinely wrong for the project. The default move is to fix the code.

If a threshold really does not fit the project, change it once, in one place, with a comment saying
why — and tell the user you did it. Silently eroding eight thresholds until the tool goes quiet is
the failure mode this tool exists to prevent.

## Reading the findings

Severities: `error` fails the build by default, `warn` and `info` do not. `-fail warn` tightens the
gate for CI.

`complexity` is **cognitive** complexity, not cyclomatic: a `switch` costs one point total rather
than one per `case`, and nesting is penalised — an `if` three levels deep costs 4. So a high score
means depth, not breadth. Fix it by extracting the nested block or inverting a guard, not by
collapsing a dispatcher into `if/else`.

Common fixes, in order of how often they are right:

| Rule | Usual fix |
|---|---|
| `go.func.complexity` | extract the deepest block into a named function; invert conditions into early returns |
| `go.func.long` / `go.func.statements` | split by responsibility, not by line count |
| `gen.nesting` | early return, or lift the inner loop out |
| `go.file.funcs` / `gen.file.long` | move a cohesive group of functions to a sibling file |
| `go.doc.missing` | write what it does, not what its signature already says |
| `go.err.discarded` | handle it, or explain in one line why discarding is correct |
| `go.global.mutable` | make it a constructor's field; if it is a read-only lookup table it is already exempt |
| `arch.import.forbidden` | this is an architecture violation, not a style nit — never disable it |
| `arch.file.missing` | a directory breaks the layout contract the project declared in `requiredFiles`; add the file or add an exact-pattern exception |

`funcLines` excludes blank and comment-only lines, so documenting a function cannot push it over.

## Dockerfiles

`droast` / `filet docker` finds unpinned `FROM`, root users, apt hygiene, `COPY . .` before the
dependency install, shell-form `CMD`, secrets in `ENV`/`ARG`, missing `.dockerignore`, missing
`HEALTHCHECK`, and single-stage builds on a toolchain image.

`docker.secret` and `docker.curl.pipe` are security findings. Surface them first and never bundle
them into a list of style nits.

## Tests

`filet test` detects the project (go, cargo, bun, pnpm, yarn, npm, deno, pytest), runs every suite it
finds, and prints pass/fail plus duration per suite. Extra arguments pass through:

```sh
filet test -- -run TestParse -v
```

Prefer it over guessing the project's test command. If it detects nothing, say so instead of
inventing one.

## Reporting back

Lead with the counts and the grade if you ran `roast`. Then the findings that need a decision from
the user, then what you fixed. Quote the rule id so the user can look it up with `filet rules`.

Do not paste the raw output wholesale when it is long — summarise, and keep the full list for the
findings you are acting on.
