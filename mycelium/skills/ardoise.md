# ardoise — freelance paperwork PDF generator

Binary: `ardoise` (needs the `typst` CLI on PATH)
Config: none — a YAML job file in, PDFs out

Reads one YAML job file of provider, client, and document data, compiles Typst
templates into PDFs (service invoice, maintenance quote, and the matching
contracts), and emits only the document types present in the file.

**This has nothing to do with the `Ardoise` invoicing product.** Same word,
different project: `Ardoise` is a deployed invoicing app with Stripe and a
database; `ardoise-cli` is a standalone Bun binary that stores nothing. Do not
wire them together on the strength of the name.

## When to apply

Use when the user asks to generate a French freelance invoice, quote, or
contract PDF from a YAML file.
Triggers: "invoice", "invoice pdf", "quote", "devis", "contract", "ardoise",
"job.yml", "papier", "facture"

## Commands

```
ardoise                          Read ./job.yml, write PDFs next to it
ardoise -f clients/spacex.yml    A different job file
ardoise -f spacex.yml -o out/    Write the PDFs into out/
```

One run produces one PDF per document block found in the YAML.

## Rules
- YAML in, PDFs out — the CLI never writes anything besides the PDFs (and the
  removed intermediate `.typ` files). It stores no state.
- Requires the `typst` binary on PATH; it shells out to it.
- Output is named from the client name, or from an explicit `output_name` in
  the YAML.
- Do not conflate this tool with the `Ardoise` invoicing product — no shared
  code, data, or config.
