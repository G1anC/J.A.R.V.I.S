  Facile end-to-end encrypted paste. Use when the user asks to seal (encrypt),
  reveal (decrypt), or revoke a secret snippet, or mentions Capsule or an
  encrypted share.

# capsule — Facile E2E-encrypted paste

Binary: `capsule`
Config: `~/.capsule.yml` (only `server_url`; no env vars)

Capsule encrypts content client-side with AES-256-GCM and uploads only the
ciphertext. The decryption key rides in the URL fragment, which HTTP clients
never send to the server — so the URL itself is the credential.

## When to apply

Use when the user wants to share a secret snippet, a key, or a configuration
value, decrypt one already shared, or revoke an expired/leaked reference.
Triggers: "seal", "reveal", "revoke", "encrypted paste", "paste a secret",
"capsule", "share a key", "cap_"

## Commands

```
capsule seal "<content>" [--expires 1h] [--no-burn]   Encrypt and share
capsule reveal <url>                                   Decrypt and print plaintext
capsule revoke <url> --token <token>                   Destroy a capsule early
capsule config set server <url>                        Point seal at an instance
```

## Rules
- `seal` prints the **shareable URL on stdout** and the **delete token on
  stderr** — redirect stdout to capture only the link; capture both to use the
  token later.
- **The URL fragment after `#` is the secret.** Never log, echo, or paste a
  capsule URL into chat, issue trackers, or file names whole — treat it as a
  credential.
- The delete token is the only way to revoke; if you did not keep the stderr
  line and did not burn on seal, there is no way to take the capsule back.
- `--no-burn` keeps server-side burn-on-read off; default behaviour may destroy
  the capsule when read.
- `reveal` prints plaintext to stdout and nothing else — redirect if you must,
  but prefer keeping it off the terminal in shared sessions.
- There is no account. Zero-knowledge: the server never sees plaintext or keys.
- `reveal`/`revoke` ignore `server_url` and derive the instance from the URL.
