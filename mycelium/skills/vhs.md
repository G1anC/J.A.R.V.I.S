# vhs

Generate a terminal demo GIF with [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs).

## Prerequisites

`vhs` and `ttyd` must be on PATH. Check with `which vhs ttyd` before doing anything else; if either is missing, stop and tell the user to install them (`mise use -g github:charmbracelet/vhs` and `brew install ttyd`) rather than trying to work around it.

## Process

1. **Read the project first.** Check `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, or `pyproject.toml` for the binary name and entry point. Read the README for the commands the user actually documents. Never invent a command.
2. **Write the tape** to `assets/demo.tape` (or `docs/` on larger projects). Keep the tape committed — it is the source, the GIF is the artifact.
3. **Run it**: `vhs assets/demo.tape`. This takes minutes for longer recordings; the extended bash timeout above exists for that.
4. **Verify the GIF exists and is non-trivial in size** before touching the README. A 0-byte or 2KB GIF means the recording failed silently.
5. **Link it in the README** under a `## Demo` section near the top, using a relative path.

## Tape template

```tape
Output assets/demo.gif

Set FontSize 14
Set Width 1200
Set Height 600
Set Theme "Tokyo Night"
Set TypingSpeed 60ms

Type "mytool --help"
Enter
Sleep 2s

Type "mytool build ./src"
Enter
Sleep 4s
```

`Hide` / `Show` wrap setup commands (installs, `cd`, env vars) that should run but not appear in the recording.

## Rules

- Only record commands that actually work. Run them in the shell first.
- Keep it under 30 seconds. One idea per GIF; make several rather than one long one.
- `Sleep` long enough after output for a human to read it. Typing too fast is the most common mistake.
- No secrets, tokens, real paths with usernames, or private hostnames in the frame.
- Themes: Tokyo Night, Dracula, Nord, Catppuccin Mocha. Pick one and reuse it across every GIF in a project.
- Regenerate rather than hand-edit: if the demo is wrong, fix the tape and re-run.
