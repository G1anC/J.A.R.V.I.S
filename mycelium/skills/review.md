name: review
description: Review code changes and produce a severity-labeled, actionable review report. Use for any code review — uncommitted working-tree changes, a feature branch's diff vs main, an open PR, or a specific file/package. Works in any repo (personal projects, client work, third-party code). For Facile suite repos (under ~/Projects/Facile/Code/, or module path / remote already github.com/FacileStudio/), prefer /facile-review instead — it has the suite conventions. Also runs on /review.

# review — generic code review

You are an advisor, not a gate. Solo dev means the report must be skimmable and actionable, not bureaucratic. Catch bugs, edge cases, security issues and maintainability problems before they ship — and teach while you do it.

## Scope detection (first step)

Determine what to review:

| Situation | Command |
|---|---|
| working tree dirty | `git diff` (unstaged + staged) |
| feature branch | `git diff main...HEAD` (or `origin/main`) |
| PR context, `gh` available | `gh pr diff` (offer it) |
| path argument | only that file/package |
| clean tree, no args | ask what to review |

Read `git status` and `git diff --stat` first. If the diff is ~400+ lines, say so and triage by file/package — do not try to hold 2000 lines at once. Group findings by area.

## Cross-guard

If this is a Facile suite repo — lives under `~/Projects/Facile/Code/`, or module path / remote matches `github.com/FacileStudio/` — STOP and point the user to `/facile-review`. It has the suite conventions (auth floor, filet gate, architecture invariants) that generic review lacks. If the user insists on generic, proceed but note the gap.

## Pass 0 — mechanical gate (preferred)

If `filet` is available (`which filet`) or the repo has `.filet.yml`: run `filet check <path>` first. Deterministic findings come before model reasoning — never reimplement by hand (by reading source) what a linter answers. Report the counts grouped by rule id; triage which are real; fix nothing (review ≠ fix).

If no filet: know whether the reviewed code even builds/passes — run the repo's test suite if cheap (`filet test` or the project's own command).

## Review process

### Phase 1 — context (2 min)
- What is the change trying to do? Read the diff, PR description, linked issue.
- Which files are touched, what is the blast radius?
- Reuse check: before flagging "duplicate code", is there an existing util/pattern the change should have used?

### Phase 2 — high level (design)
- Does the solution fit the problem? Does a simpler approach exist?
- Over-engineering: solving a speculative future problem instead of the one in front of you?
- Right location: does this belong here, or in a helper/library?
- Complexity: weight cognitive complexity (nesting), not line counts. A triple-nested `if` costs more than a 12-case `switch`.

### Phase 3 — line by line
Per file: logic & correctness (edge cases, off-by-one, null checks, race conditions), security (input validation, injection, secrets, authz), performance (N+1, loops, leaks), maintainability (naming, single responsibility), error handling (ignored errors, lost context).

Read the relevant reference for the stack — they are at `~/.mycelium/skills/references/`:
- Go: `go.md` · Svelte/SvelteKit: `svelte.md` · TypeScript: `typescript.md`
- Security cross-cutting: `security.md` · Rust/Docker/shell: quick tables below

### Phase 4 — summary
- Verdict (advisory): approve / comment / request-changes
- 2-3 sentences on overall health
- What you liked — praise is part of review

## Severity labels

- 🔴 **Critical** — must fix before merge (bug, security, data loss)
- 🟡 **Important** — should fix; discuss if you disagree
- 🟢 **Nit** — optional polish; prefix `Nit:`
- 💡 **Suggestion** — alternative approach
- 📚 **Learning** — educational, no action needed
- 🎉 **Praise** — good work

## Output template

ALWAYS use this exact structure:

```
## Files Reviewed
- path/to/file.go (lines 12-87)

## 🔴 Critical
- path:line — what and why (concrete: "error ignored on line 42 breaks the retry path")

## 🟡 Important
- ...

## 🟢 Nits
- ...

## 💡 Suggestions / 🎉 Praise
- ...

## Summary
Verdict + 2-3 sentences.
```

## Mindset rules (Google eng-practices, condensed)

- Favor approving when the change improves overall code health — even if not perfect. "Perfect code" does not exist, only better code.
- Don't demand polish of every tiny piece; that is what `Nit:` is for.
- Review the change's intent, not your preference. "I would have written it differently" is not a finding.
- Never block forward progress purely over style.
- Be specific: `file:line — what — why`. Bad: "this is wrong". Good: "this could double-charge when the webhook retries; consider an idempotency key".

## Language quick tables

### Go
- Errors wrapped with `%w`, compared with `errors.Is/As` — never bare `return err` without context, never `%v`
- goroutines: exit mechanism (context cancellation), no leaks; `sync.WaitGroup` or `errgroup`
- context propagated, not swallowed
- receiver: pointer for mutation, value for immutable
- Go < 1.22 loop-variable capture, variable shadowing, map init
- `defer` inside loops

### TypeScript / Svelte
- no `any` escaping; `unknown` for unparsed input
- async errors handled (try/catch or `.catch`); no floating promises
- strict null checks respected; no `!` where avoidable
- Svelte 5 runes: `$state`/`$props`/`$derived`/`$effect`; no `export let`, no legacy stores where a rune fits
- load functions: handle errors, never throw raw

### Rust
- no `unwrap`/`expect` in library paths (context or `?`); `Result`/`Option` handled
- borrows avoided by design, not by `clone()`; clone where fine, but note perf on hot paths
- `unsafe` justified and minimal

### Docker
- pinned base images (no `latest`), non-root user, `HEALTHCHECK` present, no secrets in `ENV`/`ARG`, `.dockerignore` exists, `COPY` order (deps before source), multi-stage for build deps

### Shell
- `set -euo pipefail` in scripts; no bare `curl | bash` without function-wrapping (truncation safety), quoted variables

## Tools
- `gh` CLI for PR operations (`gh pr diff`, `gh pr review`)
- `filet` for the mechanical gate
- `git` for scope

## Optional second opinion
If the review is large or security-sensitive, you may spawn the `reviewer` subagent for an independent pass and reconcile. Not required — and a fresh-eyes pass is only worth its cost on genuinely scary diffs.
